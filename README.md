## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn about how to do a responsive website without media queries, and using only flexbox

```css
.container{
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    ...
}
```
```css
.card {
  flex: 1 1 375px;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to improve my use of Flexbox and I will learn some CSS Grid
